# Honzuki-PCB-Bookmark
This contains the PCB design files for the bookmark for "Ascendance of a Bookworm" series by Maya Kazuki.

Below is the instructions on how to order the PCBs from JLCPCB.

## Ordering PCBs
1. Start by downloading the "Ascendance of a Bookworm Bookmark-GERBER.zip" file in the main directory.
2. Go to http://jlcpcb.com/quote
3. Click the "Upload" button and upload the file downloaded in step 1.
4. Once the file has uploaded, be sure to get all the settings to match the image below. Settings of note are 2 layers, blue PCB color, ENIG-RoHS Surface finish. 
The ENIG gives you the gold plating so if you want to go with a cheaper, silver color choose "LeadFree HASL RoHS"
